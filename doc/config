local_config
------------
config file that is read in the beginning and its parameters override
parameters from app.config. String.

apps
----
list of process names to send a reload config signal on call
eworkman_handler:config_reload. Every item is a tuple with app_name
and a list of process names which will be sent the signal.

pid_file
--------
file to write erlang VM pid into. String.

web_server_opts
---------------

The 'web_server_opts' section contains parameters for yaws web server which
is started by eworkman_handler. If the whole section is missing then no
web server is started.
The parameters (for more information on parameters see yaws server doc
and sources):
  id - id
  docroot - document root
  sconf - local parameters for virtual server
  gconf - global web server parameters

pools
-----

Section 'pools' is used by eworkman_handler to create pools of workers. The
section is a list of pool items. Each pool item is a list of {key, value}
tuples. The pool item can contain the following items:
  id - pool id. Atom. No default
  min_workers - amount of workers to start in the beginning
  restart_delay - delay in seconds before restarting crashed worker. Integer.
    Default: 10
  restart_policy - policy for restarting crashed worker. Atom. Possible values:
    restart (immediate restart), none (ignore), delay (restart after delay).
    Default: none
  worker_duration - time in seconds for worker to operate. After that time
    eworkman_handler restarts the worker. Integer.
    Default: 86400
  worker - list of parameters for a worker. Possible keys:
    name - command for spawning. String. No default.
    debug - list of debug items ({key, value} tuples as usual). Possible keys:
      run - runtime information

log
---
The 'log' section contains parameters that are used by eworkman_receiver
to setup external logfile. If there is no log parameter then no attempt
to setup the logfile is done. It's better to setup only one of
ejobman and eworkman log parameters.
The parameters:
  log - the value is a directory name and the beginning part of a filename.
  String. Default: "/var/log/erpher/ewm"

log_rotate
----------
Rotate interval for logs. Atom. The log file is rotated at the beginning of
a time interval. E.g.: for 'day' it would be 00:00:00.
Possible values: minute, hour, day, {dow, 0..7}, month, year, never.

debug
-----

The 'debug' section keeps parameters for eworkman_receiver. The section
is a list of {key, value} tuples, where the key is an atom and the value
is an integer. The bigger value is, the more verbose debug logs (and
the slower the erlang VM works). You are warned.
The possible keys:
  config - config related information
  run - runtime information
  worker - worker spawning
