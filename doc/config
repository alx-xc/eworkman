The path to the config is defined in the 'CONFIG' atom in ejobman.app file.
The default value is the string "/etc/erpher/ejobman.conf". To change
the default path one can use the '-config' parameter at the release start.
The config is a list of {key, value} tuples (the value can be a list itself).

The list can contain the following sections:

- rabbit
- web_server_opts
- debug
- handler
- pools
- log

rabbit
======
The 'rabbit' section contains AMQP connection parameters.
The parameters:
  port - broker's port. Integer. Default: 5672
  host - broker's host. Atom. Default: '127.0.0.1'
  user - username to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"guest">>
  password - password to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"guest">>
  vhost - virtual host to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default: <<"/">>
  exchange - exchange to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"test_exch">>
  exchange_type - exchange type to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary.
  Default: <<"topic">>
  queue - queue to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"test_queue">>
  routing_key - routing key to use in rabbit-mq connection. Binary. Default:
  <<"test_rt_key">>

web_server_opts
===============
The 'web_server_opts' section contains parameters for mochiweb that
is started by ejobman_handler. If the whole section is missing then no mochiweb
is started.
The parameters:
  port - port to bind. Integer. No default
  name - name of a registered process. Atom. No default
  ssl - ssl flag. Boolean. No default
  ssl_opts - list of ssl options (every option is a {key, value} typle).
  No default.
  The options:
    certfile - path to ssl certificate. Must be part of ssl_opts. String.
    No default
    keyfile  - path to ssl key file. Must be part of ssl_opts. String. No
	default

debug
=====
The 'debug' section keeps parameters for ejobman_receiver. The section
is a list of {key, value} tuples, where the key is an atom and the value
is an integer. The bigger value is, the more verbose debug logs (and
the slower the erlang VM works). You are warned.
The possible keys:
  config - config related information
  run - runtime information

handler
=======
The 'handler' section keeps parameters for ejobman_handler. The section
contains the following items:

url_rewrite - list of rewrite items. Every rewrite item can contain
the following:
  src_type - type of src_host_part. Optional. Possible values: regex, none.
  Default: none
  src_host_part - string or regex the input host (host only!) is matched
  against. String. No default
  dst_host_part - replacement for the source host (host only!). String.
  The source host is used if dst_host_part is undefined. No default
  dst_host_hdr - string to be used as "Host" header. String. No default

max_children - the max number of disposable children. Integer. Default: 32767

debug - a list of {key, value} tuples, where the key is an atom and the value
is an integer. The bigger value is, the more verbose debug logs (and the slower
the erlang VM works, thanks to error_logger). You are warned.
The possible keys:
  config - config related information
  run - runtime information
  http - web related information

pools
=====
Section 'pools' is used by ejobman_handler to create pools of workers. The
section is a list of pool items. Each pool item is a list of {key, value}
tuples. The pool item can contain the following items:
  id - pool id. Atom. No default
  min_workers - amount of workers to start in the beginning
  restart_delay - delay in seconds before restarting crashed worker. Integer.
    Default: 10
  restart_policy - policy for restarting crashed worker. Atom. Possible values:
    restart (immediate restart), none (ignore), delay (restart after delay).
    Default: none
  worker_duration - time in seconds for worker to operate. After that time
    ejobman_handler restarts the worker. Integer.
    Default: 86400
  worker - list of parameters for worker. Possible keys:
    name - string to be used for spawning. String. No default.
    debug - list of debug items ({key, value} tuples as usual). Possible keys:
      run - runtime information

log
===
The 'log' section contains parameters that are used by ejobman_receiver
to setup external logfile.
The parameters:
  log - the value is a directory name and the beginning part of a filename.
  String. Default: "/var/log/erpher/ejm"
