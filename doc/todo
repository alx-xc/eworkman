TODO:

- use catch and/or timeout for ejobman_long_worker:cmd call
  in ejobman_handler_cmd:do_one_long_command. Because we don't want to crash
  handler on worker timeout.
- compile and store regexp in ejobman_handler config preparation
- logrotate
- config reload:
  - amqp reconnect?

DONE:

- check for correct data on receive
- add api add_pool, add_worker
- format functions for edoc to work. That means put an empty line (or a line
  with just one dot, he-he...) after a function body
- after application:stop() + application:start() there is something wrong with
  amqp messages consuming. It looks like the old consumer still exists
  (while it doesn't actually) and rabbit sends messages both to old and new
  consumers. One message at the turn to one consumer. So the new consumer gets
  just a half of the messages. To get an another half one has to restart
  erlang VM (or completely eradicate old consumer from the rabbit's brain).
  DONE (shutdown timeout + trap exit in receiver)
